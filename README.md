# Machine-Learning

      Linear regression is used in machine learning to predict the output for new data based on the previous data set.The objective of linear regression is to find a straight line which best fits the data points scattered in X-Y axis. When data samples can not be fit through a straight line with linear regression, when the datasets is much more complex, when relationship between data points are complex, we need to look towards Polynomial regression.
      In this project Linear regression and polynomial regression are performed on breast cancer dataset for finding best fit line and perfect accuracy.
